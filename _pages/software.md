## LaMa

<img src ="../images/Logo_LaMa.png" align = "right" width = "180"/>

I wrote the R package `LaMa` for flexible model building and fast estimation of **latent Markov models**. It makes building such models much more convenient (kinda feels like stacking lego blocks) and allows for significant speed gains, so give it a try!

* Check out the entire documentation <a href = "https://janoleko.github.io/LaMa/" target = "_blank">here</a>

## EgoCor
I assisted <a href = "https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/wirtschaftswissenschaften/lehrbereiche/stats/team/julia-dyck-(m.sc.)/" target="_blank">Julia Dyck</a> in developing the R package `EgoCor` as a user-friendly interface based on the R package `gstat` to fit exponential parametric models to empirical semi-variograms to model the spatial correlation structure of health data.
