## Lcpp  
<img src ="../images/Lcpp_logo_new.png" align = "right" width = 20%/>

I wrote the R package **Lcpp** for flexible model building and fast estimation of **latent Markov models**. It is far from finished, but already makes building such models much more convenient (kinda feels like stacking lego blocks). So give it a try!

## EgoCor
<a href = "https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/wirtschaftswissenschaften/lehrbereiche/stats/team/julia-dyck-(m.sc.)/" target="_blank">Julia Dyck</a> and I developed the R package **EgoCor** as a user-friendly interface based on the R package `gstat` to fit exponential parametric models to empirical semi-variograms to model the spatial correlation structure of health data.
