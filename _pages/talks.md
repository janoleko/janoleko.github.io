**Inference on the state process of periodically inhomogeneous hidden Markov models**<br>
<span style="color:grey">16. February 2024,
Young Researchers Workshop of the Center for Statistics, Bielefeld University
</span><br>
I held a short presentation about our paper [Inference on the state process of periodically inhomogeneous hidden Markov models for animal behaviour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14583). We established novel tools to better understand the state process of periodically inhomogeneous hidden Markov models regarding i) the periodically varying unconditional state distribution and ii) the state dwell-time distribution. This was illustrated using the movement track of an elphant from the Ivory Coast. You can download the slides [here](../files/slides/slides_YRW.pdf).

**Mitigating consequences of the Markov assumption**<br>
<span style="color:grey">24. October 2023,
Colloquium of the Center for Statistics, Bielefeld University
</span><br>
I presented the results of my master thesis which focussed on methods for mitigation the undesired consequences of the Markov assumption in hidden Markov models. In particular, I derived properties of the state process of periodically inhomogeneous Markov chains, and extended the model class of hidden semi-Markov models to allow for inhomogeneity in the state dwell-time distributinos. You can download the slides [here](../files/slides/slides_ZeSt.pdf).
