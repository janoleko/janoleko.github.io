## 2024

- [Robert Bajons](https://www.wu.ac.at/statmath/faculty-staff/faculty/robert-bajons/), [Rouven Michels](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/wirtschaftswissenschaften/lehrbereiche/stats/team/rouven-michels-(b.sc.)/), [Marius Ã–tting](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/wirtschaftswissenschaften/lehrbereiche/stats/team/marius-otting-(m.sc.)/) and I participated in the [NFL Big Data Bowl 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2024). We developed the metric **prevented expected points (PEP)** to measure the value of tackles. Sadly, we did not make a top-ten ranking, but we received an [honorable mention](https://x.com/StatsbyLopez/status/1753151459892367574?s=20).

## 2023

- I wrote a small [Shiny App](https://janoleko.shinyapps.io/DartsOptimizeR/) to optimise your Darts strategy depending on your individual skill level. Click [here](https://github.com/janoleko/DartsOptimizeR) for the code.

- I wrote the small R package [PandemicSim](https://github.com/janoleko/PandemicSim) to simulate pandemics with various characteristics, loosely based on the **SIRS** model.
