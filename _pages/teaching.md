* If you want to learn implementing HMMs and their extension (HSMMs, cont.-time HMMs, SSMs, MM(M)PPs) yourself, click [here](https://github.com/janoleko/Lcpp/tree/main) to check out the vignettes of the `R` package [LaMa](https://janoleko.github.io/software/). They provide various illustrative examples for a wide range of latent Markov models.
