## Tutorials

**Practical session on hidden Markov models (HMMs)**<br>
<span style="color:grey">Bielefeld University, summer term 2024</span>

If you want to learn how to implement HMMs and their extension (HSMMs, cont.-time HMMs, SSMs, MM(M)PPs) yourself, click [here](https://github.com/janoleko/Lcpp/tree/main) to check out the vignettes of `Lcpp`. They provide various illustrative examples for a wide range of latent Markov models.

**Practical session on generalised linear models (GLMs)**<br>
