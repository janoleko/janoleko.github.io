Hi, I'm Jan-Ole!

I'm a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/wirtschaftswissenschaften/lehrbereiche/stats/index.xml" target = "_blank">Statistics and Data Analysis Group</a> at Bielefeld University.

## Interests

I'm mainly interested in **doubly stochastic processes** like hidden Markov models, state space models and point processes and applications in ecology and sports.
